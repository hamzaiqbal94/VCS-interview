    Warm Up Questions
</h2>
<p>
    Name: Ina Siddiqui <br>
    Age: 29 <br>
    Years of education: 18 <br>
    Years of work experience 5 <br>
    Years of unskilled work experience: 0 <br>
    Years of service sector work experience: 0 <br>
    Are you an introvert or extrovert ? A mix <br>
    Interface Chosen: Self Check Out Machines <br>
    Where can this interface be found: All supermarkets and chain retailers, like Target, Duane Reade etc <br>
    
</p>

<br>

<h2>
    Hamza Iqbal:
Describe your last experience with a self checkout machine interface ? 

</h2>

<p>Ina Siddiqui:
    I used them in Italy, I have used before but I would like to know more about how these methods work.
    </p>
<br>
<h2>
    Hamza Iqbal:  
So what are some of the some of these (self checkout) methods that you mentioned that are confusing and that you'd like to learn more about?

</h2>
<p>Ina Siddiqui:  
    I'll give you all like a small useage only kind of map of how it goes about, for me, I pick three or four things from the vegetable section, or from the fruit section to put in a polyethene bags, and you have to weigh them and see, like, where, you know, like, from which kind of category they are, if they're organic, if they're not organic, and all that. So you get all of that I get there, and I try to you know, start scanning it. And to my, you know, dismissal, I see that I have to select each and every fruit, I have to select which exactly which category it is from, is it a Spanish onion, or it's a Portuguese onion, and I have to make that selection over there and weigh it, which is rather easy, you just have to place it, and I can you know, get a cost and you know, I can move on to the next item. So it, it kind of it kind of needs you to remember a system and kind of need you to remember where exactly you picked it from what exactly is the name of that? Like the full name and the product code, I would say. 
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Hamza Iqbal:  
        So would you say that the issue is not just the self checkout (interface) , but also the bagging and pricing interfaces in the fresh produce section?
        </h2>
    <p>
        Ina Siddiqui:  
        Yeah, I would say for me, majorly, that was a problem, because they want me to remember each and every detail of the commodity that I've been buying, and be able to select exactly that. Because if I'm not doing that, if I made a mistake, and I select like a more expensive produce of the same potato or onion, or if I select like a cheaper one, then I'm kind of cheating. And if I'm not, then I'm getting duped. So I have to like find the perfect, you know, produce, like from the, from the images that they have, which are not very accurate, or they don't like really differentiate, they use the same kind of imagery for almost every kind of variant of the product. And you have to like you really have to remember what code it was or you have to remember what country it came from, whether it was organic, or it was not organic.
        </p>
<br>

<h2>Hamza Iqbal:  
    So you're more concerned with bagging and weighing items, than the checkout machine, right. So that is one part, moving to the self checkout machines where you actually don't like make the payment and checkout, would you like to share your experience of that part of the transaction? Now let's talk about the checkout process where you go to a self checkout machine, and you scan the items, and then you back them and you pay for it. So let's talk about that experience is what are your thoughts on that experience? How was your most recent self checkout experience?
    </h2>
    <p>Ina Siddiqui:  
        The most recent self checkout experience was yesterday. And like I said, that it's confusing, it was confusing for me to see what I have bought, because I did not remember the exact name for it. Then again, I had to call customer care, I had to bring a ring them up because I wanted to put like put my number details and get some discount, which I think if you're not checking out yourself, the person tells you and so I definitely needed assistance with that. And I would say that I'm new with this process and everything, but the interface doesn't did not help me to really go through the things even though the call to action buttons and things like that (exist but are) not color coded well. And there's no way to know once you're through, there's no confirmation message. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Hamza Iqbal:  
            So in all the different self checkout machines that you've used at different retailers, do you think one is more user friendly than the other? Or are you generally intimidated by the fact that each machine might be different, or each interface might be different?
            </h2>
        <p>Ina Siddiqui:  
            I think that's a very good question. Because I do think that the machines are different, considering different brands, different retail outlets, they do have certain, points of commonality for example, you have to, like you know, the process you have to scan the product, pick it and get the weight and everything. But overall I would say they have like a different interface. And the one that I have been using is very archaic. And it's almost like, you know, like it's been created in 2000s or something.
            </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Hamza Iqbal:  
            A lot of the help or assistance offered is through signage near the self checkout machine, does it bother you that that's the first point of contact is no one, there's no human service agents there. And that's only the second option, if you fail to follow the directions, it's only then that you could approach a customer service staff.
            </h2>
        <p>Ina Siddiqui:  
            What I have usually seen as they usually have this Help button, which is like a help elevator button in which like, things go really wrong. And you know, you have to press this red button. And once you press it, like somebody comes to you, and they kind of, you know, help you out in a more clinical way, and they just, you know, try to get done with you. And, you know, because you're a real pain was not able to understand the technology and went for a self-checkout but still need help. So it's it feels a little, I would say demotivating, because you wanted to do it by yourself, but ultimately, you needed help, and they are also kind of condescending, so it doesn't really help. What I appreciate about is that, you know, the individuality. And I would prefer not to speak to people as much. So I would prefer to use that. But the times that I have to, you know, I need to take some assistance and everything I would prefer to have (direct support).
            </p>
        <br>
    
        <h2>Hamza Iqbal:  
            Would you say you miss human interaction at the checkout counter when you're doing a self checkout?
            </h2>
        <p>Ina Siddiqui:  
            Yes, I do. I do miss it. Like, on some on some aspects, like, you know, especially like discounts or any kind of offer that I might be missing. I would like somebody to tell me and you know, make myself more aware.
            </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Hamza Iqbal:  
            Are you usually influenced by sales staff up selling items, or suggesting items for you to buy?
           </h2>
           <p>Ina Siddiqui:  
            Um, not so much. I would say that I'm very overconsumptive,  I buy what I need, and I always know what I need.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>Hamza Iqbal:  
                Do you bring a tote bag with you? When you go shopping for groceries?
                </h2>
                <p>Ina Siddiqui:  
                    Yes, I always do. Especially because I'm self checking out. So I need that thing on my own.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Hamza Iqbal:  
                        Do you mind bagging your own groceries?
                        </h2>
                        <p>Ina Siddiqui:  
                            Yeah, I'm totally cool with it. Yeah.
                            </p>
                            <br>
    <h2>Hamza Iqbal: 
        Approximately, what percentage of your overall transactions are paid for electronically? Or by card? Like non cash transactions?
        </h2>
        <p>Ina Siddiqui:  
            Almost all of them, like except for like, I don't know, like, if you go into a small shop, and they don't take cash, is when I have to shell out like $1 or two. That's all.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>Hamza Iqbal: 
                What percentage of transactions are completed through self checkout? Or our online shopping transactions? Where you don't have human interaction?
                </h2>
                <p>Ina Siddiqui:  
                    I would say like 70% 60 to 70%.  
                    </p>
                    <br>
            <h2>Hamza Iqbal:  
                In general, if you would like to offer feedback to grocery stores and other places where you find such self checkout machines or interfaces, what advice would you offer to them?
                </h2>
                <p>Ina Siddiqui:  
                    I would kind ask them to have those scanning systems much more accurate or provide like a tagging system so that when you're actually scanning produce like with something that you cannot like, understand that where does it go, it's able to formulate it on its own, in which it's able to tell you that, you know, it belongs here rather than you yourself recognizing, remembering, where did you pick it from? What is the code number and all of that. And then also, I would advise them to also have a look at a lot of online retail stuff like, you know, Amazon grocery and things like that and see how they are kind of displaying information and, you know, allocating things, how much? Because are they giving any added information along with the product while you're checking out or if they're not? So yeah, I would say that, you know, it does need like a re-do for sure.
                    </p>

                    <h3>*** UPDATE FROM INA ***</h3>
                    <p>'Hi Hamza, A couple days ago, I was scanning my items at a self checkout machine and I had two small things like one avocado and a bottle of vitamins.The checkout machine wasn’t working well due to slow tech in the machinery which sent a prompt to one of the attendants. The attendant was suspected theft and played the whole 15 secs (security camera) recording twice to see if I was messing with the self checkout system or trying to get away without scanning items. When she was satisfied, she fixed the scanning device and helped me out. But it did leave me feeling a little weird and being constantly under surveillance and suspicion - and a little bit annoyed and embarrassed to be honest.'
